# Landing Page Project for Udacity Front End Web Development

## Notes

I made some changes after initial review.

### Requested improvements
 - I had previously used a css property to achieve the scrolling effect, but I switched it to javascript to satisfy the rubric

### Other improvements
- Changed some functions to arrow notation
- Changed the method for deciding where in the scroll each section should get focus

------------

## Previously

I used the provided HTML and CSS styling to start the Landing Page project.

I added javascript to select the section elements and use the information in those to create navigation in the header.

I used javascript to add an eventlistener to each section to check to see if it was in the window and made it active if it was. I also added styling to the cooresponding menu item as well to indicate that it was active. I didn't add any extra styling to the active sections beyond what was already in place in the existing css (gradient background and turning on the animated circles). If you want me to, I can add more styling in that section of the css.
